# TFCGymWeb

This is a web dev course project built for Toronto Fitness Center, a fake gym branches in Toronto.

We use Django and REST Framework for backend, and React.js for frontend.

You can run startup.sh to setup the environment for running the project, and run run.sh everytime you need  to run the project.

Make sure startup.sh and run.sh are in the root folder.
